    body: `<p class="mb-6 text-text-primary font-light">There is a place in the mouth of the Bengal delta where the river does not flow — it swallows. The mangroves of Sundarban stretch like blackened fingers into the Bay of Bengal, and within that labyrinth of roots and tidal mud, the air itself tastes of rot and salt and something older. Something that predates the gods.</p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-text-primary font-light">This is not a story that was invented. It is a story that <em>surfaced</em> — like a body pushed up through the silt after the tide retreated in the winter of 1757, the year the British East India Company tightened its grip on Bengal after the fall of Murshidabad.</p>
    <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-[rgba(42,61,46,0.15)] to-[rgba(58,74,92,0.1)] border border-accent-gold-dim rounded-lg p-5 my-8 relative">
      <p class="text-[0.65rem] tracking-[0.2em] uppercase text-accent-gold mb-2 font-heading">Historical Context</p>
      <p class="text-[0.9rem] text-[#8a7e6a] mb-0">The Battle of Plassey (June 23, 1757) marked the effective British conquest of Bengal. In its aftermath, the East India Company imposed brutal taxation on rural communities. The Sundarbans became a zone of near-total colonial neglect — and exploitation.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="mb-6 text-text-primary font-light">The villagers of the Sundarbans do not call the forest "forest." They call it <em>বন — the living dark.</em> And within the living dark, there is a boundary. An invisible line drawn not on any map, but in faith. Cross it, and <strong>Bon Bibi</strong> protects you. Cross it without her blessing, and something far older than Bon Bibi is already watching.</p>
    <div class="text-center my-10 text-text-muted text-2xl tracking-[0.6em] opacity-50">· · ·</div>
    <p class="mb-6 text-text-primary font-light">In the village of Karamkali — a name that no longer exists on any surveyor's map — there lived a man called Hakim Dukhi. He was a salt trader who worked the tidal flats from October to March, cutting salt crystals from the shallow basins where the brackish water evaporated under a merciless sun.</p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-text-primary font-light">Dukhi had a daughter. Her name was Rokeya, and she was seven years old in the autumn of 1756. She spoke rarely, but when she did, the older women in the village said her voice carried a weight that did not belong to a child. <span class="text-accent-blood font-normal">As if something spoke through her that had been waiting a very long time to be heard.</span></p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-text-primary font-light">It was after his wife Nasima's death that Dukhi first crossed the line. The invisible boundary at the edge of the deep forest — the place where the mangrove roots grew so thick and tangled that no boat could pass. Every fisherman understood: <strong>do not enter the deep forest without first performing the ritual to Bon Bibi.</strong></p>
    <div class="border-l-2 border-accent-blood pl-5 pr-5 py-3 my-9 bg-accent-blood-dim rounded-r-md italic text-[#b89e7a] text-[1.2rem] leading-[1.7]">
      Bon Bibi was their protector. A Muslim saint who ruled the forest and kept the great tiger at bay. The tiger had a name: Dukham Raja, the King of Sorrow. He was not merely a beast. He was the forest's hunger made flesh — devouring not just bodies, but the last breath, the final prayer.
    </div>
    <p class="mb-6 text-text-primary font-light">But Dukhi did not sing the Palah. He was too angry. Too grieving. Too hungry. He entered the deep forest on a moonless night in October, carrying only a lantern and a small axe.</p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-text-primary font-light">The mangrove canopy closed above him like a jaw. The water around the roots was perfectly still, black as oil, and in its surface he could see nothing reflected. Not the lantern. Not his own face. As if the water was not water at all, but a membrane over something vast and patient beneath.</p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-text-primary font-light">The third thing he noticed was Rokeya. She was standing at the edge of the water, ankle-deep in the black stillness. She was looking at him the way the forest was looking at him.</p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-text-primary font-light"><span class="text-accent-blood font-normal">"Baba,"</span> she said. Her voice was layered — as if two mouths spoke at once. <span class="text-accent-blood font-normal">"You have come to the wrong door."</span></p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-text-primary font-light">He ran. The forest let him go — but not without taking something. A shadow followed him everywhere after that night. Not his own. It moved at a different angle to the light. And it was always, always, <span class="text-accent-blood font-normal">facing the forest.</span></p>
    <div class="text-center my-10 text-text-muted text-2xl tracking-[0.6em] opacity-50">· · ·</div>
    <p class="mb-6 text-text-primary font-light">The village elder, Bibi Hafiza, organized the ritual immediately. Forty men gathered at the edge of the deep forest at dawn. Hafiza sang the Palah — the full version, the old version, the one that took three hours to recite.</p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-text-primary font-light">But the Palah, this time, did not work. The lamps flickered and died — all forty of them, simultaneously. And in the sudden dark, the men heard <span class="text-accent-blood font-normal">a child laughing.</span></p>
    <div class="text-center my-10 text-text-muted text-2xl tracking-[0.6em] opacity-50">· · ·</div>
    <p class="mb-6 text-text-primary font-light">In December, the tide did not retreat. Each morning, the waterline was two feet higher than the night before. The mud flats were submerged. The lower homes began to flood.</p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-text-primary font-light">Hafiza said the tide was not rising. She said the forest was <em>reaching</em>.</p>
    <div class="border-l-2 border-accent-blood pl-5 pr-5 py-3 my-9 bg-accent-blood-dim rounded-r-md italic text-[#b89e7a] text-[1.2rem] leading-[1.7]">
      "The boundary was not a line between us and the dark," she told Dukhi. "It was a promise. Bon Bibi's promise. But you did not just break the promise. You invited it to come and see what was on this side. And now it is tasting."
    </div>
    <p class="mb-6 text-text-primary font-light">On the night of December 22nd, Rokeya stood in the center of the flooded village square and spoke in a voice that was no longer a child's — it was singular, vast, and old.</p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-text-primary font-light"><span class="text-accent-blood font-normal">"Bon Bibi made a promise. But promises are made between two parties. He broke his promise first. And when he came to me without the song — he did not enter the forest."</span></p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-text-primary font-light"><span class="text-accent-blood font-normal">"I entered him."</span></p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-text-primary font-light">Hafiza sang the verses that came before — the ones that spoke not of the saint but of the seal. The original boundary. The first wall between hunger and the world of the living.</p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-text-primary font-light">The water broke.</p>
    <div class="text-center my-10 text-text-muted text-2xl tracking-[0.6em] opacity-50">· · ·</div>
    <p class="mb-6 text-text-primary font-light">The tide retreated in a single night. Karamkali was half-destroyed. Fourteen people were dead — though some of the bodies showed no water in their lungs. They simply looked <em>empty</em>.</p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-text-primary font-light">Dukhi was found at the edge of the deep forest, face-down in the mud. The shadow was gone. His lips were moving — singing, softly, the Palah. He died before he finished the verse.</p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-text-primary font-light">Rokeya was gone. Only, at the exact spot where she had stood, a single handprint in the mud. Pressed deep into the earth — not pushed down by weight, but <em>pulled</em>, as if something beneath the surface had taken her hand and drawn her down.</p>
    <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-[rgba(42,61,46,0.15)] to-[rgba(58,74,92,0.1)] border border-accent-gold-dim rounded-lg p-5 my-8 relative">
      <p class="text-[0.65rem] tracking-[0.2em] uppercase text-accent-gold mb-2 font-heading">Historical Aftermath</p>
      <p class="text-[0.9rem] text-[#8a7e6a] mb-0">Karamkali does not appear on any East India Company survey map after 1758. The Bengal delta was subject to massive geographic upheaval throughout the 18th century — entire villages erased by cyclones and tidal surges. The Bon Bibi Palah tradition, once suppressed by colonial authorities, was quietly revived by surviving communities.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="mb-6 text-text-primary font-light">Hafiza lived another eleven years. She spent them at the edge of the deep forest, singing. On the nights when the tide came in higher than it should have, she would sit at the boundary line and sing the old verses. The ones that spoke of the seal.</p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-text-primary font-light">The fishermen who passed by on those nights said they could hear something else beneath her singing. A second voice. Low and vast and patient. Not joining the song.</p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-text-primary font-light"><em>Answering it.</em></p>`
